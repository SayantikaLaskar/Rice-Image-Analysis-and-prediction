## Introduction
Rice Image Analysis and Prediction is a machine learning project designed to identify different varieties of rice grains from images. The project implements multiple deep learning models to compare their performance on this classification task.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of different rice varieties. Each image is labeled with the corresponding rice variety. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Models
We use the following models for classification:
- **CNN**: A custom Convolutional Neural Network.
- **Xception**: A deep learning model pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **ResNet**: Another robust model pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **VGG16**: A deep learning model known for its simplicity and effectiveness, pre-trained on ImageNet.

## Training
Each model is trained on the training set, validated on the validation set, and evaluated on the testing set. We use data augmentation techniques to enhance the training data and improve model generalization.

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and ROC curves. We also compute AUC scores for each class.

## Results
The results include:
- Training and validation accuracy/loss curves.
- Confusion matrices for each model.
- ROC curves and AUC scores for each class.

## Requirements
To run the project, you'll need the following packages:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rice-Image-Analysis-and-Prediction.git
   cd Rice-Image-Analysis-and-Prediction
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset:
   Ensure your dataset is structured with images divided into appropriate training, validation, and testing directories.

3. Train the models:
   Run the training script for each model. For example, to train the Xception model:
   ```bash
   python train_xception.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the models:
   After training, evaluate the models using the evaluation scripts. For example, to evaluate the Xception model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_xception.py
   ```

5. View the results:
   The results, including plots and metrics, will be saved in the `results` directory.
